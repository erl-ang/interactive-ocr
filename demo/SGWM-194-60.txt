1 ENCLOSURE 1 THE NETHERLANDS JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, WHILE AGREEING THAT DIFFERENT INTELLIGENCE REQUIREMENTS EXIST AT DIFFERENT COMMAND LEVELS, SUGGEST THAT AS MUCH USE AS POSSIBLE IS MADE OF EXPRESSIONS AND FORMATS IN CURRENT NATO USE. IN PARTICULAR THAT “INITIAL AND LATER REPORTS” BE CHANGED TO “INITIAL AND AMPLIFYING REPORTS” (A.P.T.I CHAPTER 9) AND THAT THE RAINBOW SYSTEM BE USED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. THE NETHERLANDS THE S.G. CONSIDER IT MORE APPROPRIATE THAT THE TERMS “INITIAL REPORT” AND “AMPLIFYING REPORT” SHOULD BE CONFINED TO TACTICAL ENEMY REPORTING AS AT PRESENT. NO AMENDMENT CONSIDERED NECESSARY. 
2 17 & 18
2 SECTION 11 THE NETHERLANDS JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF POINT OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN SIGNALING AND REPORTING EFFORT IN CONNECTION WITH THE MOVEMENTS OF SOVIET BLOC WARSHIPS, AND DRAW ATTENTION TO THE AGREEMENT ON THIS SUBJECT BETWEEN NATIONAL AUTHORITIES IN ACCHAN. THEY SUGGEST THAT SIMILAR AGREEMENTS WOULD BE VALUABLE IN OTHER AREAS AND WOULD LIKE S.G.N OR THE MAJOR NATO COMMANDS TO STIMULATE SUCH AGREE-MENTS. THE NETHERLANDS THE S.G. NOTES THAT THE REQUIREMENT FOR COOPERATIVE EFFORT IS STATE DAGAIN IN ENCLOSURE 1 PARAGRAPH 2(B). IN ADDITION SACLANT HAS DRAWN ATTENTION TO THIS POINT IN HIS LETTER SER N-1156 18 NOV-EMBER 1959 ADDRESSED TO THE NLR’S AND OTHER MAJOR COMMANDERS. NO AMENDMENT CONSIDERED NECESSARY.

SECTION 11 A THE NETHERLANDS JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF DRAW ATTENTION TO THE VERY REAL DANGER OF SOVIET BLOC SHIPS BEING EMPLOYED TO INTERCEPT ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION (PARA 6 OF ENCA57L/49 DATED 19 JULY 1957 REFERS) AND SUGGEST THAT THIS ENCA DOCUMENT BE CONSIDERED IN CONNECTION WITH MC 90. THE NETHERLANDS A. THE S.G. BELIEVE THAT NATIONS WILL HAVE CONSIDERED THIS POINT WHEN COMMENTING ON MC 90 AND THAT ANY AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESSES REQUIRED IN THE FUTURE CAN BE MADE BY CORRIGENDUM, NO AMENDMENT CONSIDERED NECESSARY.
